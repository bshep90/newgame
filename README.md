# NewGame Tactical Demo

This repository contains a simple two-player tactical board game implemented in `tactical_game.py`.

## Running the Game

The game is a text-based Python program. Run it with:

```bash
python tactical_game.py
```

Players take turns entering coordinates for the piece they wish to move and the destination square. The board is an 8Ã—8 grid. Each unit is represented by an emoji.

Win by eliminating the opponent's command unit or moving your own command unit to the far side of the board.
